You will also be required to do proper research before you apply for a loan. Some of the important factors that should be kept in mind for getting a low interest rate include:</p> <p><strong>Credit score - </strong>Making sure that your credit score it above par will result in you availing a loan at a fairly good interest rate. The better your CIBIL score the lower the interest rate added to the loan and vice versa.</p> <p><strong>Down payment -</strong> Making a down payment upward of 20% of the loan amount will result in you availing a loan at a better interest rate. The bigger the down payment, the better the interest rate.</p> <p><strong>Debt-to-income ratio -</strong> Always ensure that your EMIs, credit bills and other debts do not cross 40% of your annual or monthly income. Having a good debt-to-income ratio will boost your chances of availing a loan with a good interest rate.</p> <p><strong>Loan shop - </strong>Financial portals such as BankBazaar is of great help when loan shopping. On the BankBazaar website, individuals can compare loan interest rates offered by its partner banks and can narrow down on a loan with the best interest rate relative to the tenure - one that suits their budget.</p> <p><strong>Your employment and experience - </strong>This is one factor banks and NBFCs take into consideration when approving or rejecting a loan application. If you've had a stable income and worked for a reputed company, it's likely that you could very well negotiate on a decent interest rate.</p> <p><strong>Make sure that you negotiate - </strong>Negotiating the interest rate on your loan is absolutely necessary. Most people just go ahead with the numbers set by banks and NBFCs, but making a negotiation will help you in the long run.</p> <p><strong>Tenure - </strong>Choosing your tenure directly reflects on the interest rate added to the loan amount. Choosing a shorter tenure will result in you having a much less interest rate - though the EMIs will be considerably low. The interest rate increases with the length of the payback period.</p>"

For pre-closures, HSBC Bank charges up to 3.75% of the outstanding principal amount of the personal loan. </p><p>If the customer chooses to pre-close the loan or when the loan is completely paid back to HSBC Bank, the bank will issue a No Due Certificate to the customer to confirm that the personal loan has been closed. </p><p>HSBC Bank allows partial prepayments for personal loans up to 20% of the original disbursed amount. The customer can make 2 partial prepayments in a year and this can be done only after one year since the loan has been disbursed.

Benchmarks adopted by the bank help in computing this interest, with two benchmarks currently in use. While interest rates computed according to base rates have been used for a while, MCLR benchmarks were introduced recently, following RBI directives.</p><h3>UCO Bank Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate (MCLR) (For new borrowers)</h3><p>UCO Bank introduced MCLR based benchmarks following RBI directives, with these benchmarks offering a better picture of current financial conditions. Factors like CRR, repo rate, loan tenure, operating costs, etc. have a direct correlation with MCLR, with any change in these parameters having an impact on rates payable by a borrower. The table below highlights the rates applicable as of June 2016.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>MCLR Benchmark Tenure (Period)</th><th>Benchmark Rates (MCLR)</th></tr><tr><td>Overnight</td><td>8.10%</td></tr><tr><td>1 month</td><td>8.20%</td></tr><tr><td>3 months</td><td>8.30%</td></tr><tr><td>6 months</td><td>8.55%</td></tr><tr><td>1 year</td><td>8.65%</td></tr><tr><td>2 years</td><td>9.65%</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal loan interest rates (MCLR)</h3><p>As per RBI guidelines, all consumers who avail a loan after April 1, 2016 will automatically fall under the ambit of MCLR. UCO Bank can choose to add a certain spread over and above this benchmark, with the final interest generally varying from case to case. The loan amount, repayment tenure, repayment mode (salary account with/without check-off), borrower income, etc. can all play a role in computing the final interest rate.</p><h3>UCO Bank Base and Prime Lending Rates (For existing borrowers)</h3><p>The base and prime lending rates at UCO Bank are highlighted below.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Base Rate</td><td>9.70% per annum, effective October 5, 2015</td></tr><tr><td>Prime Lending Rate</td><td>14.25% per annum, effective October 5, 2015</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>UCO Bank personal loan interest rate (Base Rate)</h3><p>The date of loan approval plays a key role in determining the benchmark one falls under, with all borrowers who availed a loan before MCLR benchmarks were introduced having an option to choose their interest mode. They can either continue paying interest determined by factoring the base rate or move to MCLR. Those who refrain from migrating will pay an interest according to the loan scheme, with rates typically ranging between <strong>12% per annum and 16% per annum</strong>. This is computed by adding a spread over the base rate, with it possible for one to avail preferential rates based on their relationship with the bank.</p><p><em>Note: UCO Bank reserves the right to change the aforementioned interest rates at its own discretion. All rates mentioned above are effective as of June 2016. Individuals looking to avail a loan from the bank are advised to check rates prevailing at the time of application.</em></p><p>Find more details about <strong><a href=\"/uco-bank-personal-loan-interest-rates.html\" title=\"UCO Personal Loan Interest rates\">UCO Personal Loan Interest rates</a></strong></p>"

Make sure that your ratio of secured loans to unsecured loans is good as the bank will consider you more responsible in this case. You must also make sure that you don't make loan applications with too many banks as it can reduce your credit score. Your job status also plays a crucial role. Make sure that you don't change jobs frequently as steady jobs and regular income are instrumental in the approval of a personal loan. The bank will only consider customers who have a steady job and are certain to draw an income that will help them clear their personal loan.</p>"

You need to check out the rates, fees, and other charges, and pick the most affordable loan. This can be done online with the help of your smartphone, laptop, or computer. All you need to do is check out the brochures of loan products on lenders' websites or visit third-party financial websites to compare and contrast interest rates.</li><li><strong>Maintain a decent credit score:</strong> After you finalise on a loan and decide to approach a lender, you need to take care of one step to proceed further. You must make sure that your credit score is maintained well. This score is given by credit bureau agencies depending on your credit behaviour. The score should ideally be 750 or above. In case your credit score is low at the time of applying for a particular personal loan, your chances of getting your loan approved will be pretty low. Hence, if you have a pretty poor score, put in that little extra effort to boost it by being properly financially disciplined. You can then apply for a loan for a better result.</li><li><strong>Job status:</strong> Your lender may actually do a background check of your job details to make sure that you have a steady source of income. You can also provide a proof of your income and proof of employment to show how much you are earning. This can be done by showing your most recent payslips, bank statements, offer letter, relieving letter, etc. Moreover, if your lender has collaborated with any of your employers, you may get preferential or special rates of interest for your personal loan.</li></ul>"

When your credit score is lower than 750, you may have lower chances of getting your loan approved. Hence, if you really want that loan, you could put in a little extra effort to enhance your credit score. This can be achieved by being spending money in moderation. You could also present a security or collateral as it will reduce the risk of your lender. In case you got an increment in your salary, you can display your income proof to show that you can afford to repay the loan promptly. You may also combine your spouse's income to boost your loan eligibility.</p>"

We are not saying using them would cut your flight expenses by half, but using them wisely would definitely reduce your expenses making your air travel economical.</p><p>Let us look at various ways to use your credit card to cut down your air travel expenses.</p><p><strong>Choose right credit card: </strong>There are a variety of credit cards available in the market that would serve your specific needs. One such card is the Airline credit card which comes with a lot of benefits for those who fly often.</p><p>Credit card issuers compete hard to attract customers and to earn business by offering various sign-up bonuses. Choosing an Airline credit card that comes up with good sign-up bonuses would reward the customer with free air miles, discounted flight tickets and many more.</p><p><strong>Accumulate more air miles: </strong>Just like how regular credit cards help you gain reward points every time you shop using a credit card, the Airline credit card offers the same benefit, but the reward points accumulated here are termed as air miles. The more you spend on your Airline credit card, the more air miles you accumulate.</p><p>Once you've gained enough miles, you can redeem them while booking your flight tickets or hotel rooms.</p><p><strong>Sign up for frequent flyer memberships: </strong>Most airlines offer frequent flyer memberships, which would help the members to earn more air miles every time they fly. You can sign up for one or more airlines' frequent flyer membership programme, as it is completely free of cost, to avail the benefits. Some memberships allow you to earn miles on one airline and redeem them on any other airline. Hence, signing up for more than one membership will help you earn more air miles every time you fly.</p><p><strong>Make use of airline promotions: </strong>Promotional offers by airlines are again a way to attract customers and to earn business in the most competitive airline space. You can take advantage of such promotional offers to make your air travel cheaper.</p><p>Some promotional programmes which offer air miles at affordable rates are the ones to grab as buying air miles at the original price is often expensive.

These include the joining fee, the renewal (annual) fee, etc.</p> <p><strong>Eligibility criteria:</strong></p> <ul><li>In addition to the other criteria, to be eligible for the premium credit cards, you need to have a relatively high annual income which is above Rs.50,000 for most such cards.</li><li>On the other hand, there are regular cards which have an income criterion of as low as Rs.12,000 per month.</li></ul> <p><strong>Joining bonus:</strong></p> <ul><li>Most premium cards offer attractive joining bonus offers like reward points in bulk, complimentary air tickets, air miles, etc.</li><li>The regular credit cards either don't offer any joining bonus and even if some of them do, it's not very rewarding.</li></ul> <p><strong>Reward points:</strong></p> <ul><li>One primary advantage of premium cards is the privilege of a highly beneficial reward points program.

Higher your income, better are your chances of availing a car loan from Axis Bank.</li><li><strong>Market fluctuation: </strong>Fluctuation in market also determines the <a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">interest rate</a> that will be charged on your loan amount. The rate of interest may be higher if the inflation is high, and similarly can be lower if the inflation rate is lower. Hence, always check how the market is performing before availing a car loan.</li><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>The loan amount will determine the rate of interest levied. Higher the loan amount, higher will be the rate of interest.</li><li><strong>Repayment tenure: </strong>The repayment tenure plays a role in the lender determining the rate of interest charged on the loan amount. Higher the repayment tenure, higher will be the interest rate charged and vice versa.</li><li><strong>Income-to-debt ratio: </strong>The lender checks the income-to-debt ratio before deciding whether they should approve your car loan or not. The income-to-debt ratio is nothing but the ratio of your income to the debt you own. Hence, in order to avail a car loan at a lower interest rate, you must ensure that your income-to-debt ratio is low.</li><li><strong>Relationship with your bank: </strong>Your relationship with the lender will also determine the rate of interest levied on the loan amount. It is always recommended that the applicant avails a car loan from the bank where he/she holds a bank account. The bank finds it easier to provide loan to a person who has been a customer of the bank for a very long time. Hence, there is a very good chance that the applicant will get a <a href=\"/car-loan.html\">car loan</a> at a lower interest rate.</li></ul>"

This is because a higher income indicates higher repayment capacity. To be eligible for HDFC Bank car loan, your yearly income should be at least Rs.3 lakh.</li><li>Loan amount - Your eligibility for a car loan from HDFC will be higher if you apply for a lower loan amount simply because if the loan amount is lower, the bank knows that the loan will be paid off quicker. Hence, they will be more confident to lend to you.</li><li>Repayment tenure - Choosing a longer repayment tenure can lower your eligibility for a car loan as it might give an impression to the bank that your ability to pay the loan is lower. This is because longer repayment tenure results in lower EMIs and the lender may tend to think that you cannot afford to pay higher EMIs. Therefore, the bank may be reluctant to lend to you.</li><li>Credit score - This is an important factor that most banks, including HDFC Bank, consider when determining your eligibility for a car loan. A credit score of 750 and above is considered a healthy credit score by most lenders. If you have a healthy credit score, banks will be happy to offer you a car loan and hence, your eligibility will be higher.</li><li>Relationship with the bank - As stated earlier, HDFC Bank offers instant car loans to their existing customers through the ZipDrive feature. This feature allows HDFC Bank customers to can avail loans instantly, at their convenience, with negligible documentation. This indicates that your relationship with the bank is an important factor while determining your eligibility.</li></ul><a class=\"pull-right\"><img title=\"Apply for HDFC Car Loan\" alt=\"Appy for HDFC Car Loan\" src=\"/images/india/infographic/HDFC_Bank_Thumbnail_12_28_17.png\"/></a>"

This is an indication of your higher repayment capacity which will lead to banks feeling confident to lend to you. So, if you wish to boost your eligibility for a car loan, opt for a shorter repayment tenure.</li><li>Keep your credit score in check - If you wish to increase your eligibility for HDFC Bank car loan, make sure that you maintain a credit score of over 750. You can use the Free Credit Score tool to check and maintain a healthy credit score. Checking your credit score regularly can let you take corrective measures to improve it if your score is low or give you confidence to approach the bank is it is high.</li><li>Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio - A low debt-to-income ratio means that you have a good balance between your earnings and spends. Before banks lend to you, they will check how much percentage of your earnings goes in paying your debts and a low debt-to-income ratio will be an indication of your high repayment capacity. To enhance your eligibility for a car loan, you should ensure that you maintain a low debt-to-income ratio.</li><li>Apply for a loan for a lower amount - By applying for a loan for a lower amount, you can increase your eligibility for HDFC Bank car loan. A lower loan amount means that the loan will be repaid sooner and hence, the chances of you being eligible for a loan is higher.</li></ul>"

That is right. Below we give you a list of things that you can do which will help you fetch the best interest rates on car loans.</p> <ul><li><strong>Compare the benefits -</strong> Before you pick a particular lender to avail a car loan, ensure that you explore the benefits offered by various lenders on their car loans. Once you have done that, compare the benefits and pick a lender that offers the <strong><a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">lowest interest rates</a></strong>. Many banks offer lower interest rates to its existing customers and hence, it is a good idea to check the interest rates offered on car loans by the bank where you hold an account. Some banks may also offer lower interest rates to new customers as part of a promotion and that is why, you should always shop around before picking a lender.</li><li><strong>Choose a shorter repayment tenure -</strong> Many car loan applicants make the mistake of choosing longer repayment tenures as the EMI amount is lower on them. However, opting for a longer repayment tenure may prompt lenders to increase the interest rates on the car loan because it gives an impression of the applicant having a low repayment capacity. Therefore, if you wish to negotiate with your lender for a lower interest rate, choose a shorter repayment tenure.</li><li><strong>Ensure that you have a good credit score -</strong> If you have a credit score of more than 750, your chances of securing a loan is higher. There are some lenders that will offer you a car loan even if your credit score is low but will charge a high interest rate. It is recommended that you check your credit scores regularly and for free on the BankBazaar website under the 'Free Credit Score' section. Once you know your credit score and if it is above 750, you can confidently approach and negotiate with the lenders to offer you a car loan at low interest rates.</li><li><strong>Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio -</strong> Lenders consider the debt-to-income ratio of the applicant along with the employment status. Whether the applicant is salaried or self-employed, they should have a steady income and a low debt-to-income ratio to avail a car loan at a lower interest rate. The debt-to-income ratio is a measure of the percentage of the applicant's income spent on repayment of loans.</li></ul>"

One of the main factors that determine the interest rate is your credit score. In case your credit score is low, the interest rates will be high, or your application will be rejected. Certain banks and NBFCs do not provide a car loan if your credit score is less than 650.</li></ul> <p>Lenders will also know that you are financially stable if the credit score is good. Lenders offer car loans at attractive interest rates if your credit score is good. Therefore, it is vital that you maintain a good credit history before applying for a car loan.</p> <ul><li><strong>Have a low debt-to-income ratio:</strong> Lenders will always access your debt-to-income ratio before providing a car loan. In case you have any pending Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs), it is advisable that you clear them as it would increase the chances of receiving the car loan. Lenders offer car loans at high interest rates if your debt-to-income ratio is high.</li><li><strong>Compare different lenders:</strong> It is important that you compare car loans from various NBFCs and banks before you opt for one. Certain lenders offer car loans at lower interest rates when compared to others. Various third-party websites such as BankBazaar.com can be used to compare car loans from various lenders. The features and benefits of the car loan can also be compared on these sites.</li><li><strong>Make a higher down payment</strong>: The loan amount provided by the lender will decrease if you make a higher down payment. Lenders also offer car loans at low interest rates in case you increase the down payment. Making a high down payment will also provide the impression that you are financially stable.</li><li><strong>Negotiate:</strong> In case you have a good relationship with your bank, the interest rate can be negotiated. The interest rate can be negotiated based on various factors such as the credit score, income status, and loan tenure.</li><li><strong>Choose a shorter tenure:</strong> The interest rates will be high in case you opt for a longer tenure. Banks usually offer low interest rates in case the repayment tenure is less than 5 years.</li></ul> <p>Even though the EMIs are low for a long repayment tenure, the interest rates will be high. Therefore, you will be paying a higher amount at the time of maturity. You can calculate the EMI by using the EMI Calculator provided by BankBazaar.com.

                        "body": "<ul><li><u><strong>Credit Clean-up:</strong></u> One of the main factors taken into consideration by lenders is your credit score. Getting a personal loan is easier with a high credit score. If your score is low, you must check your reports to see if there are any errors. Sometimes, simple errors could have an adverse effect on your scores, and if you find any of these, you must report them to CIBIL.</li><li><u><strong>Rebalancing your income and debts:</strong></u> Lenders ask for proof of income when you apply for personal loans in order to ascertain your debt-to-income ratio. Consider the sale of liquid assets like stocks or earning more through a part-time job to increase your annual income. Doing so will increase your debt-to-income ratio and increase your chances of getting a loan.</li><li><u><strong>Consider Co-signers/Guarantors:</strong></u> If you are finding it hard to get a personal loan on your own accord, you can apply for one by adding a co-signer or guarantor. The person you choose as a guarantor must have a good credit score. Their main aim is to guarantee that you will repay the loan. However, they will also be liable to repay the loan themselves if you are unable to do so. Picking an individual with a credit score over 750 will considerably increase your chances of getting a personal loan.</li><li><u><strong>Limit Your Borrowing:</strong></u> It can be risky to ask for more money than you require to meet your financial targets. Make sure that you calculate how much you need and apply only for that specific amount.</li><li><u><strong>Choose the Right Lender:</strong></u> Every lender has their own requirements when it comes to credit scores and income. When looking for personal loans, pick a lender whose eligibility criteria you meet and apply accordingly. The problem with applying with multiple lenders is that each of them will <a href=\"/credit-score.html\">check your credit score</a>, and each time your full credit report is pulled out, your credit score drops, albeit marginally.</li></ul>"

However, that is not the case. There are certain things that you should do after paying off your personal loan.</p> <ul><li><strong>The No Dues Certificate or NDC: </strong>The No Dues Certificate or NDC is issued by your lender once you pay off the debt. This is one of the most important documents that you should collect immediately after paying off your loan. It is also a wise decision to retain this document for an extended period of time. This certificate validates the repayment that you have made. Without this document you cannot prove that you have paid off your debts. In case you are looking forward to taking another loan in the near future, you will need this document to prove that your previous loan has been paid off. Usually, this document is issued on spot by your lender if you are paying off the final amount through hard cash. If you are paying via check or NEFT or any other means, the lender will issue the NDC and will either send it to your registered address or will ask you to collect it from the branch office of the lender.</li><li><strong>The Statement of Account or SoA: </strong>The Statement of Account or SoA, along with the NDC will help you prove that your debts have been completely paid off and have been paid on time. This is an optional document which is often issued by certain lenders. If your lender provides this document, you should consider getting it. However, you should also look for any sorts of discrepancies in the credit score. If you find something wrong, you can use the SoA to make the necessary changes to it.</li><li><strong>Collection of unused cheques: </strong>If you have some cheque leaves which have not been used, you should collect those as well. The collection of the No Dues Certificate and the unused cheque leaves, usually, marks the end of the closure process for the loan.</li><li><strong>Check your credit score after closing the loan: </strong>This is just a recommendation. It is not compulsory to check the credit score after the closure process ends. However, it is recommended that you check the score to make sure there are no differences in the score. If there are some chances of you availing another loan within 1 to 2 years of the closure of the current loan, it is highly recommended that you check the credit scores right after the closure of the loan.</li></ul>"

Annual fee and joining fee are minimal for the basic credit cards and the more benefits a card offers, the annual and joining fee increases. Many cards offer a waiver of annual fee if you spend a certain sum of money in a year. All in all, the benefits of the card must be greater than the fee of the card.</p>"

Here's a handy list:</p><ul><li><strong>Your spending pattern: </strong>Do you spend more on groceries each month and less on dining? Then get a card that rewards your grocery spends. If a major portion of your income goes towards online transactions, get a card that rewards those transactions.</li><li><strong>The reward type:</strong> Credit cards offer rewards in terms of cashback (which you can use to offset your bill), rewards points (which can be used to redeem lifestyle, travel, retail, and dining vouchers), and air miles (which can be transferred to your preferred airline's frequent flyer programme and help fund the tickets for your next holiday).</li><li><strong>Fees and charges: </strong>Compare the interest rate on different cards and the fees and charges apply. Look for a card whose joining fee and the annual fee you can afford. Also, see if there are any hidden charges.</li><li><strong>Offers on the card: </strong>Some cards have great offers and discounts when you use the card to shop on a particular website or when you use it at a particular store. Some offer great dining discounts and others are better suited for travel. Make sure you go through the offers available on the card before making your decision.</li><li><strong>Welcome bonus or gift: </strong>To get you to apply for their card, banks offer welcome gifts and bonuses. This could be the latest gadget or bonus points and miles. If you are looking to earn rewards at an accelerated pace, look for a card that offers a considerably large welcome bonus.</li><li><strong>Payment options: </strong>Most cards will allow you to make payments via multiple channels. In general, if you tend to forget to make payments by the due date, you should consider having your credit card payments automatically debited from your account.</li></ul><p>If you keep these points in mind, getting the right credit card shouldn't be too much of a problem.</p>"

A few exceptions to it is that fuel transactions, insurance payments, gold or gold jewellery purchases, utility bill payments, cash and EMI transactions are typically not eligible for reward points.</p><p>The accrued reward points can be redeemed for various options offered in exclusive rewards catalogues provided by the issuers.

The worst thing you can do with your card is to default on your payments. This doesn't just lead to you having to pay interest, but your credit score ends up taking a hit as well.</li><li><strong>Pay your bills in full:</strong> If you don't pay your bills in full, you lose out in two ways. One - you have to pay interest on the amount you don't pay and two - you lose out on any rewards those transactions earned.</li><li><strong>Redeem rewards:</strong> Redeem the rewards you earn since that is the best way to get the best out of your credit card.</li><li><strong>Check your card statement:</strong> Make it a habit to check your credit card statement each month. This way, you can immediately dispute any transaction.</li><li><strong>Consider not taking a credit card loan:</strong> Credit card loans or cash advances have a high rate of interest and no interest-free period. You are charged interest from the moment you withdraw money up until the time you repay the entire amount.</li></ul>"

As per the new change, the MDR will now be based on the turnover of the merchant/company rather than the current slab-based structure. The MDR is applicable not only for transactions at POS terminals but also for online transactions and QR-based transactions. As already mentioned, merchants/vendors/companies will be charged based on their turnover for the year and are segregated into two categories - merchants with a turnover up to Rs.20 lakh and merchants with a turnover more than Rs.20 lakh. For merchants with a turnover (previous financial year) up to Rs.20 lakh, a limit of 0.40% or Rs.200 will be charged for transactions online or at POS terminals. For QR-Based transactions, the MDR will be capped to a maximum of 0.30% of the transaction or Rs.200. For merchants with a turnover (previous financial year) more than Rs.20 lakh, the applicable MDR for transactions made at POS terminals or online will be limited to 0.90% or Rs.1,000.

Your card is considered authentic only if you fix your signature in the space provided on your card.</li></ul> <ul><li>Sometimes fraudsters may jam the Enter and Cancel button in an ATM machine to put your transaction on hold. In such cases, do not leave the ATM counter without cancelling the transaction.</li><li>Make sure that you have memorized your debit card PIN. Do not write down your debit card PIN number anywhere.</li><li>While making a transaction at an ATM counter, make sure that no one else is there with you.</li><li>As an enhanced security measure, keep changing your debit card PIN from time to time.</li><li>If you are withdrawing cash from ATM located in an open space, ensure that you hide the PIN combination while making the entry.</li><li>Dispose of your old debit cards if you are not using them anymore.</li><li>Do not dispose of balance receipt in the ATM counter itself. Hackers and fraudsters can use this information to gain access to your bank account.</li><li>Track your account transactions on a regular basis. This will help you in identifying any unusual activity in your account.</li><li>Register for email or SMS alerts. This will help you in staying up to date with your transactions.</li><li>While transacting at petrol bunks, restaurants, and similar places, ensure that your debit card is swiped in the POS machine only in your presence. Otherwise, there are chances of your information being skimmed. Skimming is the process of duplicating a debit card with the use of a skimming device.</li><li>In case you doubt a skimming device being installed in an ATM machine, refrain from making any transaction and inform the concerned authorities immediately.</li><li>Get your debit card blocked immediately, in case it is lost or stolen. You can do so by calling the bank on their hotline number.</li><li>Whenever you receive an email or a call asking for your account details or debit card information, report the incident to your bank.</li><li>Your bank will never ask for your debit card information. Never share your information with anyone over phone, call, or message, even if the person claims to be from the bank.</li><li>While shopping online with your debit card, make sure that the website of the e-tailer starts with 'http'. This is a sign that the website is secure and genuine.</li><li>Do not save your debit card details on merchant websites for ease of making payments. Because in case the website is hacked, you will be at the risk of losing your baking information to hackers and fraudsters.</li></ul>"

For example, consider the Big Billion Day sale by Flipkart or The Great Indian Sale by Amazon. During these sales, banks tie up with the seller companies to offer rewards to the debit card and/or credit card users. These rewards are often given in the form of cashback or additional discounts.

They deal will all aspects of personal banking, industrial and business finance, corporate banking, and investment banking, resulting in one of the widest and most extensive service portfolios offered by any financial institution.</p> <p>A personal loan from Barclays Bank means dealing with one of the biggest and most well established banking institutions worldwide, and taking advantage of the efficient and well-structured policies and protocols as a valued customer.</p> <h3>Why choose Barclays Bank Personal Loans</h3> <p>As Indians living in an essentially unstable financial market, money that's been saved today won't have the same purchasing power or value tomorrow. Savings of Rs.1,00,000 will only be worth around Rs.90,000 (or less) in 2015 - in terms of real-world purchasing power and money value. Hence, the sensible option is to invest in securities or funds that have a high rate of interest that promises you a larger sum at the end of the investment tenure. But that brings another problem with it - all your savings will be tied up in an investment and will have zero liquidity - which means that you can't really use any of that money until it matures.</p> <p>Having money tied up in investments means your liquid assets won't be enough to immediately pay for things like large assets for your business, a long-overdue international family vacation or even remodelling your home. Certain obligatory expenses need to also be met that may cost more than planned savings can afford - like giving your daughters their dream weddings, or funding your child's higher education abroad.</p> <h3>Features of Personal Loans from Barclays Bank</h3> <p>Barclays Bank offers personal loans on different terms depending on whether you're salaried or self-employed. The below table outlines the various possible loan options:</p> <table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>Salaried Individuals</th><th>Self-Employed Individuals</th></tr><tr><th>Age</th><td>21 - 60 years</td><td>24 - 65 years</td></tr><tr><th>Minimum annual income</th><td>Rs.1,20,000 p.a.

Prepayment is only allowed after 6 months of loan disbursement.</p> <strong>Barclays Bank Personal Loan Interest Rate</strong> <p>Currently, Barclays Bank charges 19% - 22% per annum. Their charges* are follows:</p> <table><tbody><tr><th>Processing Fees</th><td>2% of the loan amount</td></tr><tr><th>Default interest rate</th><td>19% - 22% per annum</td></tr><tr><th>Prepayment penalties</th><td><ul><li>4% of the principal outstanding</li><li>Prepayment allowed only 6 months from the date of disbursal.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><th>Service tax</th><td>As applicable</td></tr><tr><th>Stamp duty charges</th><td>As applicable on local regulations</td></tr></tbody></table> <p><em>*It is strongly advised to check these against any possible changes that may have been made under Barclays Bank's discretion.</em></p> <strong>Eligibility criteria for a Personal Loan from Barclays Bank</strong> <p>You must meet the following eligibility criteria for a personal loan from Barclays Bank:</p> <p><strong>Minimum age:</strong> 21 years for salaried individuals and 24 years for self-employed individuals.</p> <p><strong>Maximum age: </strong>60 years for salaried individuals and 65 years for self-employed people.</p> <p><strong>Minimum income:</strong> The minimum income of Rs.15,000 monthly take home.</p> <p>You will also require the following set of<strong> documents:</strong></p> <p><strong>Photo ID proof:</strong> Like a valid Passport, PAN Card, Driver's License, Voter's ID, etc.</p> <p><strong>Proof of Address: </strong>Like a valid Passport, Driver's License, Voter's ID, etc.</p> <p><strong>Proof of Signature: </strong>Like a valid Passport, Banker's Certificate, Driver's License, PAN Card, etc.</p> <p><strong>Proof of Age:</strong> Like a valid Passport, Banker's Certificate, Driver's License, Birth Certificate, etc.</p> <p><strong>Proof of Income:</strong> Last 2 months salary slips for salaried individuals and Latest 2 filled ITRs for self-employed people.</p> <p><strong>Banking history:</strong> Last 3 months for salaried individuals and last 6 months for self-employed people.</p> <p><strong>Job continuity proof:</strong> Like Form 16 / a relieving letter / an appointment letter.</p> <h3>How to calculate EMI on Barclays Bank Personal Loans</h3> <p>Knowing how much you'll be paying as EMI each month is important.

There are other factors that also need to be considered like the credibility of the organisation that is offering the term deposit.

If you choose to reinvest the interest that you earn, the total return on the investment will be much higher.</li><li><strong>Interest payout option: </strong>See if the FD you are investing in gives you a wide range of interest payout options. Take a look at the frequency on interest payouts. In most cases payments are made monthly, quarterly, annually or half-yearly.</li><li><strong>Penalty rates: </strong>The other thing to check before putting your money in an FD is whether there is any fee levied in case you want to prematurely break your deposit.</li></ul> <a href=\"/fixed-deposit.html?variant=slide&WT.mc_id=SEO_ARTICLE&utm_source=bb&utm_medium=seo&utm_campaign=SEO_ARTICLE\" title=\"Apply for Personal Loan\"><img title=\"Apply for Fixed Deposit\" alt=\"Apply for Fixed Deposit\" src=\"/images/india/infographic/apply-for-fixed-deposit-online.png\"/></a>"

Even though silver rates have shown a steady increase over the last two decades, the historical trends should not be taken as a benchmark when considering future price volatility. Investment in silver as a commodity has gained steam in the country, and investors need to factor in various variables if they are to make decent profits from silver in the short/long run.</p> <ol><li><strong>Large investors:</strong> The silver market is much smaller than the gold market. As such, large investors or traders can potentially influence silver prices. A point in case here is Warren Buffet buying 130 million troy ounces of silver in 1997 at $4.50/ounce, which impacted market prices.</li><li><strong>Oil prices:</strong> Mining of silver is an energy-intensive process, and so silver prices are correlated with oil prices, the primary energy source in today's world. Also, imported silver requires a strong logistics platform backed by consistent oil supply. Volatility in oil prices cause dynamic prices of both gold and silver.</li><li><strong>Industrial demand:</strong> As India moves towards greater industrialization, the need for silver as an industrial commodity has seen a spike in recent times. This is touted to drive silver prices in the near future and beyond.</li><li><strong>Import duties:</strong> As silver is primarily imported in India, silver rates are directly affected by the import duty applicable on imports. A higher import duty translates to higher silver prices in India.</li><li><strong>US Dollar fluctuation:</strong> Silver prices are inversely affected by the USD Index. This means that a strengthening USD can decrease silver rates in India, while a weakening Dollar signals increasing silver prices.</li><li><strong>Gold prices:</strong> In general, silver prices follow the upward/downward trend of gold closely. If there is a spike in demand for gold leading to increase in its price, silver will follow suit. Similarly, any decrease in gold prices will see a greater decrease in silver prices.</li><li><strong>Trade deficits:</strong> The greater the amount of imported commodities, the more will be a country's trade deficit. As the trade deficit increases, the government may take step in to take counteractive steps to curb import of commodities, such as it did in the last couple of years to rein in gold imports.</li><li><strong>Inflation:</strong> As commodities like gold and silver are preferred choices of customers to hedge their funds in times of financial stress owing to inflation, prices of silver tend to increase when inflation is high.</li><li><strong>Large Concentrated Short Position:</strong>3 or 4 of the largest silver traders currently hold 90% of all short silver contracts. This sort of concentration of a publicly traded commodity in the hands of few can have significant implications on prices of silver in the short and long run.</li></ol> <h3>Silver Measurements</h3> <p>Silver is measured in troy weight and grams. Silver may sell in troy ounces, million ounces, grams, kilograms, tonnes, short tonne, metric tonnes, tolas etc.</p> <p>Silver fineness is measured as the percentage of silver in the resulting alloy. For instance, a fineness of 900 implies 90% silver in the final product. Fineness is the parts of silver per 1000 parts. Usually copper is added to silver to produce more durable coins. Silver may also be measured in carats similar to how gold is measured.</p> <h3>Silver Demand in India</h3> <p>Silver has the dual usefulness of being a precious metal as well as an industrial metal. World over, silver is primarily traded for its industrial implications, however Indian silver imports are largely for jewelry and silverware. India is among the top 5 silver consumers in the world. About 60% of silver consumption in India is from the rural population who view it as a solid savings commodity.</p> <p>India does not produce silver in a significant scale and most of the silver has to be imported from outside the country. Moreover, silver demand has been on the rise in major growing economies like India and China during the past few years. Nascent industries such as medicine, manufacturing etc. are picking up demand for silver, and this may soon translate to higher levels of imports.</p> <h3>Silver Commodity Trading in India</h3> <p>Silver as a commodity is traded in three commodity exchanges in India:</p> <ol><li>Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX).</li><li>National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX).</li><li>National Multi Commodity Exchange (NMCE).</li></ol> <strong>MCX</strong> <p>Silver is traded in 3 contract types:</p> <strong>Silver Mini (SILVERM)</strong> <ul><li>Trading units of 5 kg.</li><li>Base value of 1 kg.</li><li>Price quotation: Ex-Ahmedabad.</li><li>Maximum order size of 600 kg.</li><li>Daily price limit of 4%.</li><li>Tick size (minimum price movement) of Re. 1 per kg.</li><li>Upper limit on positions: 60 MT for all silver contracts combined for individual investors. 300 MT or 15% of market wide open positions for a member collectively investing for all clients.</li><li>Purity grade 999 and fineness 999.</li></ul> <strong>Silver Micro (SILVERMIC)</strong> <ul><li>Trades from Monday to Friday.</li><li>Trading units of 1 kg.</li><li>Base value of 1 kg.</li><li>Price quotation: Ex-Ahmedabad.</li><li>Maximum order size of 600 kg.</li><li>Daily price limit of 4%.</li><li>Tick size (minimum price movement) of Re. 1 per kg.</li><li>Upper limit on positions: 60 MT for all silver contracts combined for individual investors. 300 MT or 15% of market wide open positions for a member collectively investing for all clients.</li><li>Purity grade 999 and fineness 999.</li></ul> <strong>Silver 1000 (SILVER 1000)</strong> <ul><li>Trades from Monday to Friday.</li><li>Trading units of 5 kg.</li><li>Base value of 1 kg.</li><li>Price quotation: Ex-New Delhi.</li><li>Maximum order size of 600 kg.</li><li>Daily price limit of 4%.</li><li>Tick size (minimum price movement) of Re. 1 per kg.</li><li>Upper limit on positions: 60 MT for all silver contracts combined for individual investors. 300 MT or 15% of market wide open positions for a member collectively investing for all clients.</li><li>Purity grade 999 and fineness 999.</li></ul> <strong>NCDEX</strong> <strong><p>Silver Futures Contract (SILVERHEDG)</p></strong> <ul><li>Trades from Monday to Friday.</li><li>Trading units of 30 kg.</li><li>Price quotation: Ex-New Delhi.</li><li>Maximum order size of 1,500 kg.</li><li>Daily price limit of 4%.</li><li>Tick size (minimum price movement) of Re. 1 per kg.</li><li>Upper limit on positions: 100 MT or 5% of market wide open positions for all silver contracts for clients. 1,000 MT or 20% of market wide open positions for a member collectively investing for all clients.</li><li>Purity grade 999 and fineness 999.</li></ul>"

At the time of buying an insurance policy, if the customer chooses a higher deductible, he/she gets to pay a lower premium. However, their liability in case of an accident or theft also increases.</li><li><strong>Add-On Covers:</strong> The kind of add-on covers that you choose affects the amount of premium you pay for your insurance policy. Some add-on covers like zero depreciation cover can really enhance the coverage of your policy. While it may be of significant help at the time of claim settlement, a customer needs to pay additional premium to avail the benefits of the same. Thus, add-on covers must be chosen wisely.</li><li><strong>No Claim Bonus:</strong> A No Claim Bonus is a concession that policyholders can avail if they have not made any claims on their bike insurance policy during the preceding year. The NCB can go up to 50% based on the number of consecutive claim-free years.</li><li><strong>Condition of The Two-wheeler:</strong> The condition of the two-wheeler including the age of the vehicle, type of fuel, area of registration, engine cubic capacity, and other aspects of the vehicle also influence the determination of the premium amount.</li></ul>"

This is also true for the rural populace who tend to invest in gold ornaments as a form of savings instead of gold bullions or ingots. The lower and middle class people in Kolhapur have an affinity towards gold.</p> <p>Gold is available in different types in Kolhapur. Therefore, gold rate in Kolhapur varies from product-to-product of the yellow metal. In general, the gold bullion rates are the lowest in the city, while jewellery, ornaments and coins tend to cost more due to the workmanship done on them.

There is a huge overlap between the two concepts though, it terms of execution.</p> <p>Investment in terms of financial context, means any money that is spent today in the hope of financial benefits that may be reaped in a future time frame. Any investment is the act of buying or creating assets with an expectation that the same would yield interest earnings or dividend or capital appreciation or any other return that is profitable as compared to the money put in initially. Almost all investments are differentiated from other kinds of transactions based on the aim of the money spent. Money spent on making investments is primarily with the aim of obtaining some sort of return in a specific period of time.</p> <p>A lot of times people confuse <a href=\"/saving-schemes.html\">savings</a> with investments. Savings and investment are different from each other in their approach of utilizing the money involved. While saving may be understood as a passive way of accumulating wealth, investment can be seen as a more aggressive way of securing returns. Mostly, under savings, customers avail a <strong><a href=\"/savings-account.html\">savings account</a></strong> and stash away cash in that account. This cash can be used as and when required by the account holder.</p>"

                        "type": "text",
                        "body": "<p>Investments made in the finance industry can be divided into two distinct types namely, Traditional and Alternative. Let us look into each of these types one by one and see what investment categories fall into which type.</p> <p><strong>Traditional Investments</strong></p> <p>Investing in well-known financial products falls into the category of traditional investments. These include bonds, shares, real estate etc. These are categories which are quite popular among investors as active investment strategies to make your money grow. Following are the investment products that fall under the category of traditional investment.</p> <ul><li><strong>Bonds</strong><p>A Bond can be understood as an IOU which is issued by an issuer (borrower) and to a lender. Generally, bonds are instruments used by public and private sector enterprises to raise huge sums of money which any bank is incapable of lending. These bonds are then issued in the public market by the borrowing entity and are bought by lenders for specific amounts of money. Thousands of lenders then come together to lend the required amount and the borrowing organization is able to raise capital for its operational or growth purposes.</p><p>However, since money is being lent to the issuer of bonds, there is also an interest component involved that is paid back to the investor in turn for his/her money. This interest is paid at a predetermined rate and for a specific period of time. Bonds fall under the category of fixed income securities since the interest on these can be exactly calculated for the time for which the bond is held. Bonds fall under the debt category and are therefore, comparatively safer financial instruments to invest in. However, with all financial tools risk is inversely proportional to returns and as such the low-risk attribute of this tool makes it a low return instrument as well.</p></li><li><strong>Stocks</strong><p>Stocks or equity are shares that are issued by companies and are bought by the general public. This offers an avenue to companies to raise funds. Stocks entitle a customer ownership of a company. Shares, stocks and equity all imply the same thing. Shares are one of the most popular investment avenues in the world. This is because the returns offered by stocks is generally higher than any other financial instrument. However, to balance out the high return associated with stocks, the risk associated with these products is also quite high.</p><p>Any business may issues different types of shares based on the financial urgency and need. In exchange for the money, shareholders are issued Stock certificates.</p><p>Stocks are mostly divided into two basic types, common stocks and preferred stocks.</p></li><li><strong>Small saving schemes</strong><p>Small savings is another popular savings tool in the Indian financial market. The name itself suggests that these tools are meant for saving money in small amounts. The idea behind this financial tool is to enable the habit of saving in people from almost all economic sections. Some of the most common small savings tools are Sukanya Samriddhi Scheme, EPF (Employees Provident Fund), NPS (National Pension Scheme, Kisan Vikas Patra, Personal Provident Fund (PPF) etc. Almost all small savings schemes are initiated and facilitated by the government so as to enhance the spread and penetration of savings schemes in the country. Let us look into some of the most prominent schemes out of these.</p><em><strong>Employees Provident Fund</strong></em><p>Employees Provident Fund is another small savings scheme that is primarily offered by your employer. This includes salaried individuals of both private and public organizations. Any company with a workforce of more than 20 employees is mandated to register for the <a href=\"/saving-schemes/epf.html\">EPF</a> scheme. Around 12% each month is deducted from the salary and contributed towards the EPF account of an employee. This EPF account is maintained by the Employees Provident Fund Organization, commonly known as the EPFO. The amount deposited towards EPF is eligible for <a href=\"/tax/tax-exemption.html\" title=\"Tax Exemption\">tax exemption</a> under section 80C of the Income Tax Act.</p><em><strong>Sukanya Samriddhi Scheme</strong></em><p><a href=\"/saving-schemes/sukanya-samriddhi-yojana-account.html\">Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana</a> is a special scheme which has been launched by the central government to facilitate the financial wellbeing of girl child in the country. This scheme can be availed by parents or legal guardian of a girl child and an amount as low as Rs.1000 per annum can be deposited under the scheme. The account matures only after the girl child reaches the age of 21. Premature withdrawal is allowed only after the girl reaches the age of 18 years and has financial need pertaining to wedding or education.</p><em><strong>National Pension Scheme</strong></em><p>National pension Scheme is one of the most popular schemes for ensuring a regular pension amount to individuals working in both the private and the public sector. NPS is offered to individuals either as part of their corporate perks or is availed by individuals on their own. The amount set aside towards <a href=\"/saving-schemes/nps.html\">NPS</a> is eligible for tax rebate under section 80C of the <a href=\"/tax/income-tax-act.html\" title=\"Income Tax Act\">Income Tax Act</a>. The scheme offers withdrawal of deposited amount only once the account holder reaches the age of 60 years. The corpus withdrawn on maturity is absolutely tax-free.</p></li><li><strong>Mutual Funds</strong><p><a href=\"/mutual-funds.html\">Mutual funds</a> are financial instruments that are professionally managed and that invest money on behalf of any investor, in different securities. These mutual funds are classified into various types based on the type of securities that they invest in. Some of the most popular mutual fund types are balanced funds, stock funds, open-ended funds etc. These funds are classified based on their percentage allocation in different securities. So, an equity fund invests purely is equity and is a high risk high return product while a debt fund invests purely in debt and money market instruments and is hence a low risk low return financial product.</p></li><li><strong>Fixed Deposits</strong><p>As the name itself indicates, <a href=\"/fixed-deposit-rate.html\">fixed deposits</a> are financial instruments that are one of the oldest and safest ways to save money. These are not necessarily active investment tools, but are rather a passive way to save and earn returns. A fixed amount of money is kept aside with a financial institution for a fixed number of days or months or years. In turn, interest is earned on this money. The rate of interest differs with the deposit tenure and also with the banking entity.</p><p>Similar to fixed deposit is the concept of <a href=\"/recurring-deposit.html\"><em><strong>recurring deposit</strong></em></a>. However, the only point of difference in the two investment tools is that while a lump-sum amount needs to be fixed in case of fixed deposit, a smaller amount needs to be deposited at regular intervals in case of a recurring deposit. Hence, customers who do not have a large chunk of money to fix in a single go can opt for a recurring deposit wherein money is usually deposited monthly for a specific deposit tenure. The rate of interest earned on recurring deposit is similar and comparable to that earned on fixed deposit.</p></li><li><strong>Real Estate</strong><p>Property rates are soaring with every passing day which has made real estate a hot investment avenue for investors. Buying, selling and leasing of property offers substantial returns to investors. Appreciation of property makes real estate a good investment tool. With urbanization gaining ground rapidly, real estate prices in certain major cities like Mumbai, Bangalore, New Delhi, are skyrocketing. This has made these places hot hubs for real estate investors. Most investors take loans from banks to purchase real estate and then lease out or sell the same property to enjoy returns offered due to appreciation in price of the property.</p></li></ul> <p><strong>Alternative Investments</strong></p> <p>Alternative Investments are those that are not regular investments like stocks, bonds etc. These are investments made in order to acquire jewelry, precious metals etc. which are expected to yield returns in future. Hedge funds, some real estate types, venture capital and derivatives also form a part of alternative investment. Alternative investments are so called due to their non-traditional as well as complex nature. Also, another distinguishing feature of alternative investments is relatively low liquidity and well as very high minimum investment limits.</p> <p>While a common investor may not access alternative investments like hedge funds or derivatives due to their complex nature, others like gold and real estate are available to even the common man. Let us look into some of the most prominent alternative investment tools known to investors.</p> <ul><li><strong>Hedge Funds</strong><p>These can be understood as a professionally managed private investment company or partnership structure. Techniques to manage the fund can be those that are not commonly allowed for SEC regulated companies. Hedge funds invest in both financial derivatives and/or publicly traded securities. These are popular as an alternative investment tool owing to their high leverage and high returns. However, they are characterized by high fees as well as low liquidity. It is seen that managers of hedge funds generally have a personal stake in the fund.</p></li><li><strong>Private Equity</strong><p>Private equity is trading in shares of an operating company that is not publicly listed and whose shares are not available on the stock market. Institutional investors employ various strategies to indulge in private equity trading. Private equity is popular since it offers diversification of financial portfolio by allowing investment in avenues that are not tightly coupled to normal investments.</p></li><li><strong>Venture Capital</strong><p>Venture Capital is one of the most popular investment strategies currently being deployed by investors in the Indian start-up scene. The idea behind this investment strategy is to invest substantial capital in a budding company in return for stocks of the same. This is done with companies who are either in their initiation phase or in their growth phase. Venture capitalism is generally based on ideas that find substance with the investors or any new technology that the investors feel might take the market by storm in future.</p></li><li><strong>Managed Futures</strong><p>This type alternative investment involves managers using futures also as part of their investment portfolio. Managed futures are a great tool to offer portfolio diversification and therefore are a great alternative to minimize risk and maximize returns. In general, a managed futures account will have sufficient exposure to different markets like energy, agriculture, commodities, currency etc.</p></li><li><strong>Structured Products</strong><p>Structured products are alternative investment tools that generally combine two or more financial instruments to make a packaged investment strategy in a single product. Most often, derivatives are combined with securities or with other derivatives. Structured products have a fixed maturity date like bonds. These offer a convenient strategy to implement a complex investment strategy across various financial products.</p></li><li><strong>Collectible items</strong><p>Collecting artifacts that have substantial value and those that have historical and artistic significance is one of the most difficult types of alternative investments. This requires knowledge of the article that you are purchasing. Mostly, collectibles like stamps, jewelry, boats, planes, art works etc. tend to appreciate in value and are considered good and profitable assets to own. The value of artifacts is generally expected to appreciate and keep pace with inflation and hence collectibles make a good form of alternative investment.</p></li></ul> <p>There are a few more alternative investment instruments available in the financial world. However, their use is limited since these are more complex products and are hence not considered by the common investor. Seasoned investors and professional investors tend to consider these alternative investment strategies to increase wealth.</p> $LPD_EMBEDDED_ITEM_INVES_1"

It is a good and profitable idea to make money from any extra cash that a person might have. Investing in various financial products lends growth to any financial portfolio. One thing that is absolutely clear is that any amount of money is sure to appear less with each passing day. This is because the value of say Rs.1000 will not be the same 5 years down the line as it is today. Same holds true for the value of Rs.100 10 years ago as compared to its value today. Hence, it is important to understand that saving alone is not enough for future financial goals. Any investor or common man needs to ensure that his or her money grows as well. Investment can be defined as any activity that involves using money in a way which offers returns in future.

A bank borrows from several sources including, fixed deposits, current accounts, savings accounts, etc. The rate of interest in these borrowing sources can be used by you for the calculation of marginal borrowing cost. You must understand that the source of a bank's funds is not only borrowing, but also the equity (retained or infused earnings). Thus, return on equity can also be expected.</p> <p>The formula prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India for calculation of MCLR is given below:</p> <p><em><strong>Marginal cost of funds = Marginal borrowing cost x 92% + return on the net worth x 8%</strong></em></p> <p>Banks must also maintain a cash reserve ratio of 4%. On this deposit, no interest is earned by the bank. Under MCLR, banks can avail some allowance called Negative Carry on CRR. Also, the operating costs must be considered and taken care of. There are several expenses of a bank that includes raising funds, opening branches, paying salary to its employees etc. These are not charged to the customers. Finally comes the discount or tenor premium. The reset period for the interest rate is called the tenor. It is directly proportional to the reset period i.e. the tenor is higher if the reset period is higher.</p> <p>Thus, MCLR depends on</p> <ol><li>Tenor premium,</li><li>Operating costs of the bank,</li><li>Negative carry on Cash Reserve Ratio, and</li><li>Marginal cost of funds.</li></ol>"

Various banks charge differently for this switch. However, there are certain banks that allow you to <strong>convert home loan to MCLR</strong> without charging anything.</p> <p><strong>Example: </strong>Consider you have borrowed an amount of Rs.40 as home loan and you intend to repay it over a tenure of 20 years. The base associated with your home loan stands at 9.95%. After a period of three years from the commencement of the loan tenure, you would have paid an amount of Rs.38,468 as your monthly instalments. You have also paid an interest amount of Rs.11,63,514. If you choose to continue on the same path with your base rate, you will be paying a total interest of Rs.52,32,428. However, if you choose you switch to MCLR for your home loan at 8.55% for the remaining tenure (17 years in this case), you will be paying an interest of Rs.34,00,396. This is the amount that you pay for 17 years. So, the total interest that you pay for your home loan is (Rs.11,63,514 + Rs.34,00,396) which comes up to Rs.45,63,910. It shows that you save a substantial amount of Rs.6,68,518 by switching to MCLR from base rate.</p> <p>So, a spending a few thousand for converting to MCLR from base rate can reward you a hefty sum in the long run.</p>"

Knowing multiple payment channels would help you pay your bills on times in case you're not able to use the same old method you used to pay your Citibank credit card bill. Mentioned below are three simple methods using which you can make Citibank credit card payment effortlessly.</p> <p><strong>Method: 1 - Standing instructions in your Citibank online account</strong></p> <p>If you have a Citibank account with the net banking service, you can opt for standing instruction feature, which allows you to set up a standing instruction on your account to pay your Citibank credit card bill on or before the due date every month. You will have an option to choose to pay either the minimum amount due or total amount due through the facility. Once the bank approves you're set up, your Citibank credit card bill will be paid automatically every month from your Citi savings account. However, make sure you have sufficient funds in the account to prevent payment failure.</p> <p><strong>Method: 2 - NEFT money transfer</strong></p> <p>If you don't have Citibank savings account, you can use any other bank account to pay your Citibank credit card bill. All you need to have is internet banking access to your savings account and you're all set to pay your Citibank credit card bill using the NEFT option.</p> <p>To pay you credit card bill using NEFT, login to your net banking account, select funds transfer, add your Citibank card as payee and make the payment. While adding your credit card as payee, mention the name imprinted on the card as payee name, credit card number as account number, bank name as Citibank, IFSC code CITI0000003 and branch address as Chennai.</p> <p><strong>Method:3 - Credit card payment through BillDesk</strong></p> <p>BillDesk is another easy way to make your Citibank credit card payment from any other bank account.

In fact, the public-sector lender reported a loss of Rs.2,416 crore for the past quarter, in contrast to the net profit of Rs 1,820 crore it made in the same quarter last year.</li></ul> <ul><li>However, if we are to look at the bigger picture and consider the 9 month period for the two financial years, we will notice that SBI is still making a profit, although the number has dropped considerably. SBI's net profit, as of December 2017, is standing at Rs.1,171 crore, in comparison to Rs.1,637 crore for the previous financial year.</li></ul> <ul><li>The decrease in profit for the past quarter is primarily due to a substantial hit in investment depreciation, hardening of bond yields, higher provisions, and higher corporate slippages.</li></ul> <ul><li>At the same time, SBI's net interest income has improved by 5.17% for the Q3 FY18. This is owing to a significant reduction in interest expenses. However, when we consider the bank's income from other sources, chiefly non-interest based, we'll observe that there has been a 29.75% drop in Q3 FY18 over Q3 FY17. The amount for the two periods stands respectively at Rs.8,048 crore and Rs.11,507 crore respectively. This is because of poor gains from the sale of investments.</li><li>The lender's asset quality has also deteriorated over the last quarter. Gross NPAs (Non-performing assets) rose to Rs.1,99,141 crore from Rs.1,86,115 crore, while Net NPA rose to Rs.1,02,370 crore from Rs.97,896 crore.</li></ul> <strong>SBI Stock Trends in 2018</strong> <ul><li>The opening price of the stock at the beginning of January 2018 on NSE was Rs.310.

In April, the stock price decreased further and was at Rs.244 by the end of the month.</li><li>The price of the stock picked up the pace in the month of May and stood at Rs.266. In June, the scrip increased further and reached Rs.282 by the mid-June however, it declined by the end of the month and was at Rs.258. The scrip gained strength in July and reached Rs.297 by the end of the month.</li><li>In August, the stock price increased marginally and ended the month at Rs.307.</li></ul> $LPD_EMBEDDED_ITEM_STOCK_1 <h3>SBI Stock Returns in 2016 and 2017</h3> <ul><li>SBI stocks commenced trading on January 1, 2016, at Rs.225 on NSE and BSE. However, over the course of the next few weeks, the SBI share price fell dramatically. When the month came to an end, the SBI shares were recorded trading below Rs.200.</li><li>This was primarily driven by the bank's decision to monetise non-core assets, change in directors, and other factors. At the same time, SBI secured a $500 million loan from Korean EXIM bank and launched its wealth management service. However, it did little to boost the confidence of investors as the SBI share price had plummeted to Rs.184.20 by the end of the month.</li><li>Things didn't change a lot in February either. SBI, in its Q3 FY16 results, announced a 61% dip in net profit. This led to SBI shares take another hit, with the stock price hitting Rs.155 after a selling spree by the investors.</li><li>However, by early March, things had taken a different turn for the investors. On March 2, 2016, SBI share price rose by nearly 9 percent owing to new RBI Basel norms. Furthermore, the bank also got the approval to operate in Myanmar, which took the SBI share price to Rs.187.50 on March 8, 2016.</li><li>The sentiment of the investors had also improved when SBI decided to raise Rs.500 crore through tier-II bonds. In addition to this, the bank also established a separate board for Chinese investors. By the end of March, the bank revised its lending rates based on new methodology - Marginal Cost of Fund Based Lending Rate (MCLR).</li><li>The month of April did not witness any major nosedive in SBI share price on NSE and BSE. Investors were taken aback in May when the government announced that SBI is yet to raise funds worth Rs.15,000 crore from the market and asked the lender to merge five associate banks. By the end of the first week, SBI share price was down to Rs.180.</li><li>The share price took another hit when the bank praised the decision to restrict lending limits for large borrowers. On May 24, 2016, SBI stocks commenced trading at Rs.168.95 on BSE and NSE.</li><li>Thereafter, there was a sharp spike in SBI share price. The price rose steadily due to the upcoming announcement of Q4 and FY16 results. On May 27, when the bank declared its quarterly results, SBI shares hit a high of Rs.202 and closed trading at Rs.195.55 on BSE. This was primarily due to the fact that the lender also declared a dividend.</li><li>In June, SBI shares were being traded above Rs.200, primarily because of the bank's merger with associate banks. With this merger set to improve the bank's market share, investors began buying SBI shares, thus pushing the price higher. By the end of June, the opening price, on average, was more than Rs.215.</li><li>By August, SBI shares were being traded for more than Rs.230. On August 19, 2016, the opening price was Rs.255 and it hit a high of Rs.260, mainly because the SBI board approved the merger with associate banks.</li><li>The onset of demonetisation pushed the stock price even higher. On November 10, 2016, the closing price of SBI stock was Rs.281.30. At the end of the year on December 30, 2016, the share price had gone down to Rs.249.75.</li><li>In January 2017, SBI shares were trading steadily above the Rs.250 benchmark. The trend did not vary significantly in the month of February as well. After the Q3 FY17 results were announced, the SBI share price hit a high of Rs.282.80.</li><li>This terrific run continued in the month of March as well, when SBI announced its plan to complete the merger with six associate banks by the end of June, along with raising its stake in SBI card. By this time, the share price of State Bank of India was hovering around Rs.290.</li><li>The lender extended its rally to the month of May when the Cabinet approved its policy pertaining to non-performing assets (NPA). This resulted in the stock price hitting a 52-week high of Rs.304.90.</li><li>However, the share price failed to stabilise at the Rs.300 benchmark. Throughout the months of May and June, the stock price continued to hover around Rs.290. The change in the directorate, coupled with rising concerns over NPA, did little to earn investors' faith. By early July, the share price was once again down to Rs.274.10</li><li>By mid-July, the share price was once again inching towards Rs.290, primarily driven by updates and the approval of SBI Life IPO by the board. This, coupled with other updates pushed the stock price of SBI to Rs.310.</li><li>Despite this great run, the stock price once again failed to stabilise and fell down dramatically. Q1 FY18 results were announced which reported a massive surge in net profit after the merger. However, this wasn't enough to keep the investors around owing to the change in directorate. As a result, the price went down to Rs.270.45 on September 19, 2017.</li><li>On October 24, 2017, the SBI stock price was recorded to be at Rs.246. However, the price recovered by 3% in late October when the bank announced a deal with Escorts for tractor financing. The very next, the share price hit a daily high of Rs.328.05 and closed at Rs.324.90. This was in anticipation of the recapitalisation package announced by the government.</li><li>From that point on till the end of the year, the share price continued to remain above Rs.300. It ended the year at Rs.309.</li></ul>"

Among all the public sector banks in the market, it is the State Bank of India which leads in the P/E column, followed by Bank of Baroda at 41. This means that for every rupee that SBI currently makes, investors are willing to pay Rs.58 in the present scenario.</li><li>However, the government-owned lender is troubled by NPA related issues, which has been increasing by the year as shown in the recent quarterly updates. This may be because of poor management at macro and micro levels and is something that needs to be rectified in order to boost investor confidence. The recent change in directorship may appear to be a step taken in the right direction, though its true impact will be known in the coming years.</li><li>Higher provisioning is another factor that must be considered when looking at purchasing SBI stocks as a long-term investment. In its Q3 FY18 report, the lender reported a 12.64% increase in total provisions over Q3 FY17 which, in turn, led to a decrease in net profit. Even though the company is still making a profit, investors will not be impressed with a poor showing on other fronts.</li><li>Even though SBI is a government-owned entity and there is very little chance that the bank will 'crash' drastically, it is still better to invest in private banks mainly because there is better governance and the NPAs are lower. Furthermore, over the last five years, SBI stock returns haven't been that impressive when compared to the returns by private banks in the same term.</li></ul>"

It is done on an hourly schedule which means that they are done in batches.

If not, the amount will be credited on the following working day.</p><p>You will need the following information to use NEFT service at Syndicate Bank:</p><ul><li>The name of the receiver</li><li>The name of the receiver’s bank and branch</li><li>The receiver’s account number</li><li>The IFSC code of the receiver’s bank branch</li><li>The amount to be transferred</li></ul><p>Following are the Service Charges on NEFT transactions at Syndicate Bank:</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Range</th><th>Transaction Charge</th></tr><tr><td>Upto Rs.1 lakh</td><td>NIL</td></tr><tr><td>Rs. 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh</td><td><p>Rs. 15 /- per transaction + ‘applicable taxes’</p></td></tr><tr><td>above Rs 2 lakh</td><td><p>Rs. 25/- per transaction + ‘applicable taxes’</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS):</strong></p><p>Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS), unlike NEFT, involves transfers being completed on an individual transaction basis which means that the clearance of funds are scheduled individually and not batch-wise.

The same can be said for your vehicle documents like registration, license, insurance, etc. If you have lost your car insurance document, you need to replace it immediately to avoid the repercussions arising out of it. The insurance document must be produced when a law enforcement official asks for it. Also, if there is any claim during this period, you need your insurance details to file it with the company. Hence, replacing the insurance documents is extremely crucial. </p> <p>The good news is that it is not difficult to get a duplicate document from your insurer. Getting a duplicate document is also essential if your insurance document is fully or partially destroyed. You can get the duplicate document through the following process. </p> <h3>File a police complaint</h3> <p>This is necessary only if you have lost your insurance document. If the document is destroyed, you may go ahead and contact the insurer directly. Filing a police complaint is essential before you visit the insurer to request for duplicate documents. Through this way, you can justify asking for duplicate documents. Also, an FIR from the police is required when speaking to relevant authorities regarding the loss of your insurance document. </p> <h3>Place a newspaper advertisement</h3> <p>This is a formal procedure while applying for duplicate documents. You have to place a newspaper ad in a state newspaper to indicate your effort in getting back the document. You must bear the cost of placing the ad. If your insurance document is lost during transit, there is a chance of getting it back through this advertisement. If not, you can proceed with the next steps in the process. </p> <h3>Contact the insurer</h3> <p>The insurer must be contacted immediately after losing your documents. The insurer may ask you to proceed with the above-mentioned steps before issuing the duplicate policy. You must also submit proofs like identity proof, address proof, policy number, etc., to the insurer while applying for a replacement. The insurer will verify the documents and issue the duplicate within a reasonable time. In exchange for this service, the insurer may charge a nominal fee from the policyholder. </p> <h3>Indemnity bond</h3> <p>You must also execute an indemnity bond before getting a duplicate copy of the policy document from your insurer. The bond should have your full name along with the signatures of two witnesses. You may also have to pay the stamp fee for executing the bond. You can contact the insurance company regarding the formalities associated with executing an indemnity bond. </p>"
